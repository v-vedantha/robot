Once the pose trajectory in the world frame is made, the iiwa controller can be fed the trajectory and will move to those positions in the world frame. Thus, regardless of where the init position is, as long as the trajectory is made based on the worldcenter, the robot will move to that given circular trajectory. If the WorldCenter is changed, then the circular path will be changed as well. The initial gripper pose is not a part of the trajectory.
